 * method, complete request URL (including scheme, authority, exact path, and

 * values only for framework-certified query-independent artifacts protected by
 * completed-response admission. An adapter that advertises

 * request header named in the returned `Vary` fields and reject `Vary: *` from
 * storage. Adapters without that capability must reject application-defined
 * variance themselves, or opt into completed-response admission and honor
 * core's resulting `no-store` policy.
 *
 * The transport is also the trust boundary for this metadata. It must
 * authenticate both directions and integrity-protect the serialized props,
 * dispatch options, and response so public callers cannot forge trusted route
 * or cache-admission state. Platform bindings can provide that boundary
 * directly; HTTP transports need equivalent authenticated, confidential
 * transport for both request-stage and response-stage endpoints.
